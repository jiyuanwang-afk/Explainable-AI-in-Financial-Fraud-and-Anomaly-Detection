# Explainable-AI-in-Financial-Fraud-and-Anomaly-Detection
This repository explores explainable deep learning models for financial fraud detection and anomaly analysis.   It integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Autoencoders, and SHAP-based explainability to identify and interpret fraudulent behaviors in transactional data.
